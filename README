SYNOPSIS
      use Test::Warn;

      warning_is    {foo(-dri => "/")} "Unknown Parameter 'dri'", "dri != dir gives warning";
      warnings_are  {bar(1,1)} ["Width very small", "Height very small"];
  
      warning_is    {add(2,2)} undef, "No warning to calc 2+2"; # or
      warnings_are  {add(2,2)} [],    "No warning to calc 2+2"; # what reads better :-)
  
      warning_like  {foo(-dri => "/"} qr/unknown param/i, "an unknown parameter test";
      warnings_like {bar(1,1)} [qr/width.*small/i, qr/height.*small/i];
  
      warning_is    {foo()} {carped => 'didn't found the right parameters'};
      warnings_like {foo()} [qr/undefined/,qr/undefined/,{carped => qr/no result/i}];
  
      [NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
      warning_like {foo(undef)}                'uninitialized';
      warning_like {bar(file => '/etc/passwd'} 'io';

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning based
    code.

    If you are not already familiar with the Test::More manpage now would be
    the time to go take a look.

  FUNCTIONS
    warning_is BLOCK STRING, TEST_NAME
        Tests that BLOCK gives exactly the one specificated warning. The
        test fails if the BLOCK warns more then one times or doesn't warn.
        If the string is undef, then the tests succeeds iff the BLOCK
        doesn't give any warning. Another way to say that there aren't ary
        warnings in the block, is "warnings_are {foo()} [], "no warnings
        in"".

        If you want to test for a warning given by carp, You have to write
        something like: "warning_is {carp "msg"} {carped =" 'msg'}, "Test
        for a carped warning">. The test will fail, if a "normal" warning is
        found instead of a "carped" one.

        Note: "warn "foo"" would print something like "foo at -e line 1".
        This method ignores everything after the at. That means, to match
        this warning you would have to call "warning_is {warn "foo"} "foo",
        "Foo succeeded"". If you need to test for a warning at an exactly
        line, try better something like "warning_like {warn "foo"} qr/at
        XYZ.dat line 5/".

        warning_is and warning_are are only aliases to the same method. So
        you also could write "warning_is {foo()} [], "no warning"" or
        something similar. I decided me to give two methods to have some
        better readable method names.

        A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false otherwise.

        The test name is optional, but recommended.

    warnings_are BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME
        Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the specificated warnings. The
        test fails if the BLOCK warns a different number than the size of
        the ARRAYREf would have expected. If the ARRAYREF is equal to [],
        then the test succeeds iff the BLOCK doesn't give any warning.

        Please read also the notes to warning_is as these methods are only
        aliases.

        At the moment, more than one tests for carped warnings look that
        way: "warnings_are {carp "c1"; carp "c2"} [{carped =" 'c1'},{carped
        => 'c2'}];>. I'm working for a better solution.

    warning_like BLOCK REGEXP, TEST_NAME
        Tests that BLOCK gives exactly one warning and it can be matched to
        the given regexp. If the string is undef, then the tests succeeds
        iff the BLOCK doesn't give any warning.

        The REGEXP is matched after the whole warn line, which consists in
        general of "WARNING at __FILE__ line __LINE__". So you can check for
        a warning in at File Foo.pm line 5 with "warning_like {bar()} qr/at
        Foo.pm line 5/, "Testname"". I don't know whether it's sensful to do
        such a test :-( However, you should be prepared as a matching with
        'at', 'file', '\d' or similar will always pass. Think to the
        qr/^foo/ if you want to test for warning "foo something" in file
        foo.pl.

        You can also write the regexp in a string as "/.../" instead of
        using the qr/.../ syntax. Note that the slashes are important in the
        string, as strings without slashes are reserved for future versions
        (to match warning categories as can be seen in the perllexwarn man
        page).

        Similar to "warning_is", you can test for warnings via "carp" with:
        "warning_like {bar()} {carped =" qr/bar called too early/i};>

        Similar to "warning_is"/"warnings_are", "warning_like" and
        "warnings_like" are only aliases to the same methods.

        A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false otherwise.

        The test name is optional, but recommended.

    warnings_like BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME
        Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the number of the specificated
        warnings and all the warnings have to match in the defined order to
        the passed regexes.

        Please read also the notes to warning_like as these methods are only
        aliases.

        Similar to "warnings_are", you can test for multiple warnings via
        "carp" with: "warnings_like {foo()}
        [qr/undefined/,qr/undefined/,{carped =" qr/no result/i}];>

  EXPORT
    "warning_is", "warnings_are", "warning_like", "warnings_like" by
    default.

BUGS
    This bad documentation, I'll make it better the next time.

    I only tested it with the simple "warn" function. It should work also
    with "Carp::carp" method, but I think, there will be problems using
    <Carp::clucks> or any other warning that gives a devel stack.

    If a method has it's own warn handler, overwriting $SIG{__WARN__}, my
    test warning methods won't get these warnings.

TODO
    Improve this documentation.

    Allow to define to test for more then one carping more convienience,
    like:

      warnings_like {foo()} [qr/division by zero/i, 
                             {carped => qr/no result/i,
                                        qr/used default output/i}];

    "warning_like BLOCK CATEGORY, TEST_NAME" where CATEGORY is a warning
    category defined in perllexwarn.

    The code has many parts doubled. This is really awkward and has to be
    changed.

    Please feel free to suggest me any improvements.

THANKS
    Many thanks to Adrian Howard, Chromatic and Michael G. Schwern, who has
    given me a lot of ideas.
